The task of the project is to distinguish between live and dead worms. The code is based on the action of the convolutional neural network (CNN) -Googlenet.
Transfer Learning was used in the project. The Googlenet network was modified for the worm photo classification task with the Deep Network Designer in Matlab. All the necessary files are available on the course website.
